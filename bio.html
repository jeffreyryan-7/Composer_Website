    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p id="bio">I was born near Chicago and grew up in Franklin Tennessee. In middle school, I started playing music for the first time and developed a deep love for percussion and improvisation. By the end of high school, I had written and premiered a marimba solo at an arts showcase and a percussion duet on a percussion ensemble concert.<br><br> 
                I currently study percussion at Northwestern under She-e Wu. During my time there, I've written and premiered five solos and three chamber works, with help from members of the percussion studio. <br><br>
                Right now, I'm working on branching out to write for other instruments and exploring composition with emphasis on performer presence (see "Essays: Becoming Fertile Rain"). <br><br>
                If you have any questions about past compositions or interest/requests for future works, don't hesitate to reach out!
